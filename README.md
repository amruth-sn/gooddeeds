# GoodDeeds

With the unfortunate recent rise of natural disasters and man-made tragedies seemingly hitting the news more often, we came to realize that there is no active platform made exclusively for volunteers and community service organizers to come together. Existing systems for community efforts are often scattered, lack incentives, and donâ€™t prioritize ease of connection between organizations and individuals who want to help. We wanted to change that by building a streamlined solution that not only encourages more people to volunteer but also supports local organizers in community service and managing disaster recovery. By providing a centralized platform, incentives for volunteers, and regular communication through automated emails, we aim to make community engagement accessible, rewarding, and impactful for everyone involved.
